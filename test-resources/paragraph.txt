But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born.
To take a trivial example, none of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it.
Nobody has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences. 
One who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure.
On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation. 
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
